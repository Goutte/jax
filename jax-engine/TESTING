# How To Test - Ruby / RSpec

1. Install the bundles for each Gemfile in `./gemfiles/*`:

    $ BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-3.2 bundle install

2. Run the specs for the testbed of your choice:
 
    $ rake testbed:rails-3.2:rspec

   You can also run rspec under each testbed in sequence:

    $ rake rspec

# Running Jax

Some tests are written in Jasmine, and several tests double as demos because
they are written as full-fledged Jax controllers. To run them, first choose a
testbed and install its bundle:

    $ BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-3.2 bundle install

Then just `rackup`:

    $ BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-3.2 bundle exec rackup

Now just visit the app at http://localhost:9292/jax .

# Generating Testbeds

The testbeds are not painstakingly created. They are generated based on
the `Bedfile`. To generate or regenerate testbeds, first install the
`testbeds` gem:

    $ gem install testbeds

... and then run:

    $ generate-testbeds

Do _not_ use `bundle exec` for this. Bundler messes with the load paths,
which is fine for a single `Gemfile` but `testbeds` requires multiple
`Gemfile`s -- one for each testbed app.
