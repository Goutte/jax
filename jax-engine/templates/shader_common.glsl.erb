/*
  If a variable isn't "shared", it will be defined specifically for this
  shader. If this shader is used twice in one material, unshared variables
  will be defined twice -- once for each use of the shader.

  Example of unshared variables:
    uniform sampler2D Texture;
    uniform float TextureScaleX, TextureScaleY;

  Example of shared variables:
    shared uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix, ProjectionMatrix;
    shared uniform mat3 NormalMatrix;
    
  You can also create shared attributes, varyings and functions.
