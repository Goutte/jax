###

An attempt at refactorization of submesh editing

tothink
* extend Jax.SubMesh.Base ?
* topmost level : use or extend Jax.Geometry.Pentagon and pipe here to vertexBuffer ?
* methods should work gracefully with slightly imperfect polygons. With all, in fact.
* need to be ultra light, opt-in
* is a full 5 trianglefan with no overlap
* should we parameterize a @pointer to vertexBuffer ? It's only a pointer, yet... +2 for git branch Benchmark
* look harder at trianglefan & trianglestripes (which incidentally is in webgl)

###
A Geodesic Sphere Dual mesh
Its faces are 12 pentagons and the rest are hexagons.
Of course, these are made of respectively 5 and 6 triangles,
almost equilaterals.

With 0 subdivisions, it's a dodecahedron (12 pentagons, 0 hexagon)
With 1, it looks like a football
With 2, it looks like a golfball
With 3 and more, it looks like a Civilization V map

Don't use it with more than 3 subdivisions

ยก THIS SCALES BADLY ! O(4^n) at least

Options:

* size : the size of the geode in units. Defaults to 1.0.
* subdivisions : the number of times each face is divided into 4 triangles before dualization. Defaults to 0.

Example:

    new Jax.Mesh.GeodesicSphereDual
    new Jax.Mesh.GeodesicSphereDual size: 2, subdivisions: 1

Demos:

* See geodes.js.coffee
